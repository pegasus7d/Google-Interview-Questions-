# Google Interview Questions

This repository contains solutions to Google interview questions with detailed approaches and explanations. All solutions are implemented in **C++**.

## Structure

Each question is documented in a separate markdown file following this **exact format order**:
1. **Problem Statement**: Clear description of the problem
2. **Examples**: Input/output examples (at least 2-3)
3. **Constraints**: List all constraints
4. **Approach**: Step-by-step breakdown (4 steps: Understanding, Strategy, Algorithm Design, Edge Cases)
5. **Solution**: C++ code implementation with explanation
6. **Complexity Analysis**: Time and Space complexity
7. **Key Insights**: Important takeaways from the problem
8. **Alternative Approaches**: Other solutions (optional)
9. **Related Problems**: Similar problems (optional)

**See [FORMAT.md](FORMAT.md) for detailed format guidelines.**

## How to Use

1. Create a new markdown file for each question (e.g., `01-two-sum.md`)
2. Follow the template structure provided in `TEMPLATE.md`
3. **Maintain the exact format order**: Problem Statement → Examples → Constraints → Approach → Solution → Complexity Analysis → Key Insights
4. Add your C++ solution code with proper formatting
5. Include at least 2-3 examples with inputs, outputs, and explanations
6. Update this README with links to all questions
