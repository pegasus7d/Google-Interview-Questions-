# Cursor Rules for Google Interview Questions Repository

## Project Overview
This repository contains Google interview questions with detailed solutions in C++ format, documented in markdown files.

## Code Standards

### Language
- **Always use C++** for all code implementations
- Use C++17 or later standards
- Include necessary standard library headers

### Code Style
- Use `Solution` class structure (common in LeetCode-style problems)
- Include proper C++ headers: `#include <vector>`, `#include <unordered_map>`, etc.
- Use `using namespace std;` or fully qualify standard library names
- Add clear comments explaining the logic
- Use meaningful variable names

### Documentation Format
When creating or updating question files, **MUST follow this exact structure and order**:

1. **Question Title** (H1) - `# Question Name`

2. **Problem Statement** (H2) - `## Problem Statement`
   - Clear description of the problem
   - What is being asked
   - Any important assumptions

3. **Examples** (H2) - `## Examples`
   - At least 2-3 examples
   - Each example should have:
     - Input
     - Output
     - Explanation
   - Format: `### Example 1`, `### Example 2`, etc.

4. **Constraints** (H2) - `## Constraints`
   - List all constraints
   - Input size limits
   - Value ranges
   - Any special conditions

5. **Approach** (H2) - `## Approach`
   - Must break down into 4 steps:
     - **Step 1: Understanding the Problem** (H3)
     - **Step 2: Identifying the Strategy** (H3)
     - **Step 3: Algorithm Design** (H3)
     - **Step 4: Edge Cases** (H3)

6. **Solution** (H2) - `## Solution`
   - Contains two subsections:
     - **Code Implementation** (H3) - C++ code in code block with `cpp` syntax
     - **Explanation** (H3) - Line-by-line or section explanation

7. **Complexity Analysis** (H2) - `## Complexity Analysis`
   - **Time Complexity** (H3)
   - **Space Complexity** (H3)

8. **Key Insights** (H2) - `## Key Insights`
   - Important takeaways
   - Learning points
   - Pattern recognition

9. **Alternative Approaches** (H2) - `## Alternative Approaches` [Optional]
   - Other possible solutions
   - Different time/space trade-offs

10. **Related Problems** (H2) - `## Related Problems` [Optional]
    - Links to similar problems
    - Variations of the problem

**CRITICAL**: Follow this exact order. Do not rearrange sections.

## File Naming Convention
- Use format: `##-problem-name.md` (e.g., `01-two-sum.md`, `02-valid-parentheses.md`)
- Use lowercase with hyphens for problem names
- Number files sequentially

## Code Formatting
- Use proper indentation (4 spaces or consistent tabs)
- Add comments for complex logic
- Include function documentation with `@param` and `@return` tags
- Format code blocks with `cpp` syntax highlighting

## When Adding New Questions
1. Copy the TEMPLATE.md structure
2. Follow the exact format order: Problem Statement → Examples → Constraints → Approach → Solution → Complexity Analysis → Key Insights
3. Fill in all required sections completely
4. Provide working C++ code in the Solution section
5. Include at least 2-3 examples with inputs, outputs, and explanations
6. Break down Approach into 4 steps (Understanding, Strategy, Algorithm Design, Edge Cases)
7. Add the question link to README.md
8. Ensure code is correct and well-commented
9. Use proper markdown heading levels (H1 for title, H2 for main sections, H3 for subsections)

## When Editing Existing Questions
- Maintain the same structure
- Keep C++ code consistent with existing style
- Update explanations if code changes
- Ensure all code examples are in C++

## Important Notes
- Never use Python, Java, or other languages - only C++
- Always explain the approach before showing code
- Include complexity analysis for every solution
- Add edge case considerations
- Keep explanations clear and educational
