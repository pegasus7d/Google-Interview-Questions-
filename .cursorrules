# Cursor Rules for Google Interview Questions Repository

## Project Overview
This repository contains Google interview questions with detailed solutions in C++ format, documented in markdown files.

## Code Standards

### Language
- **Always use C++** for all code implementations
- Use C++17 or later standards
- Include necessary standard library headers

### Code Style
- Use `Solution` class structure (common in LeetCode-style problems)
- Include proper C++ headers: `#include <vector>`, `#include <unordered_map>`, etc.
- Use `using namespace std;` or fully qualify standard library names
- Add clear comments explaining the logic
- Use meaningful variable names

### Documentation Format
When creating or updating question files, follow this structure:
1. **Problem Statement** - Clear description
2. **Examples** - Multiple examples with explanations
3. **Constraints** - List all constraints
4. **Approach** - Step-by-step breakdown:
   - Step 1: Understanding the Problem
   - Step 2: Identifying the Strategy
   - Step 3: Algorithm Design
   - Step 4: Edge Cases
5. **Solution** - C++ code with explanation
6. **Complexity Analysis** - Time and Space complexity
7. **Key Insights** - Important takeaways
8. **Alternative Approaches** - Other solutions if applicable
9. **Related Problems** - Links to similar problems

## File Naming Convention
- Use format: `##-problem-name.md` (e.g., `01-two-sum.md`, `02-valid-parentheses.md`)
- Use lowercase with hyphens for problem names
- Number files sequentially

## Code Formatting
- Use proper indentation (4 spaces or consistent tabs)
- Add comments for complex logic
- Include function documentation with `@param` and `@return` tags
- Format code blocks with `cpp` syntax highlighting

## When Adding New Questions
1. Copy the TEMPLATE.md structure
2. Fill in all sections completely
3. Provide working C++ code
4. Add the question link to README.md
5. Ensure code is correct and well-commented

## When Editing Existing Questions
- Maintain the same structure
- Keep C++ code consistent with existing style
- Update explanations if code changes
- Ensure all code examples are in C++

## Important Notes
- Never use Python, Java, or other languages - only C++
- Always explain the approach before showing code
- Include complexity analysis for every solution
- Add edge case considerations
- Keep explanations clear and educational
